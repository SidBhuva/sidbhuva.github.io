<h1>Lambeshwar ni Pol</h1>
<p>'Pol’ is word derived from Sanskrit ‘Pratoli’ meaning gate or entry. It is a traditional self contained micro neighborhood, traversed by narrow streets usually terminating squares with community wells, notice boards, and Chabutaras (bird feeders), generally occupied by the people from same community or profession. This Pol gets its name from a jain temple called Lambheshwar nu Derasar. It was built Shvetamber sect of the jains who are the idol worshipers. Apart from the intricately carved bird feeder, one gets to see other building with richly carved wooden pillars, beams and brackets in the neighborhood.</p>
