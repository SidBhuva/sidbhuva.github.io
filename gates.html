city of Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India.

<p>
<font size="6">A</font>hmedabad was founded over the ancient settlement of  
<b><i> Ashaval </i></b> in <tt>1411</tt> by <u> Ahmed Shah </u> of Gujarat Sultanate. He built the first citadel Bhadra Fort starting from Manek Burj, the first bastion of the city. The Bhadra Fort had eight gates excluding palace gates. When the city expanded, Ahmed Shah built the second fort which was later fortified by <u> Mahmud Begada </u> in <tt>1486</tt>. The second fort had twelve major gates and other smaller gates. After arrival of railways, British built two more gates to facilitate the movement. Later the citywalls were demolished leaving the gates as monuments.
