<h1>Khara Kuva ni Pol</h1>
<P>Khara literally meaning salt water well and this pol is name after such a community well in the pol. This pol is entered through a poll Gate.There is a Jain Derasar near the gate. Surprisingly here, the Colormark influence is more evident in the building facades. Once comes across various symbols and motifs pertaining to the british period. One common motif engraved is that of an European lady reading book. Probably to promote education amongst females. There are buildings that are influenced by the art deco style.</p>
