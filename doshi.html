<h1> Doshiwada ni Pol </h1>
<p>This area is mostly inhabited by goldsmith community Main road is lined with lots of small & medium jewelry shops. There are many haveli type houses with profusely decorated facades in the pol. Towards the end of the pol is a beautiful carved Chabutara with stained glasses. This is a unique example of colonial-influence on an architecture of chabutras. There is also landmark building once considered tallest in the walled city.</p>
