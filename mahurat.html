<h1>Muhurat Pol</h1>
<p>
Opposite to the Old stock Exchange building is a Pol Called Mahurat Pol. Mahurat meaning an auspicious time to start something new. Here the word probably applies to the first pol being established in the city of Ahmedabad. Hence the name Mahurat pol - the first residential area built in the city. The pol contains many residential buildings built in Gujarati Vernacular architecture. The Pol Gate appears to have undergone changes in due course of time.</p>
